	abstract = {ZBar is an open source software suite for reading bar codes from various sources, such as video streams, image files and raw intensity sensors. It supports many popular symbologies (types of bar codes) including EAN-13/UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-8, Code 128, Code 39, Interleaved 2 of 5 and QR Code.

The flexible, layered implementation facilitates bar code scanning and decoding for any application: use it stand-alone with the included GUI and command line programs, easily integrate a bar code scanning widget into your Qt, GTK+ or PyGTK GUI application, leverage one of the script or programming interfaces (Python, Perl, C++) ...all the way down to a streamlined C library suitable for embedded use.

ZBar is licensed under the GNU LGPL 2.1 to enable development of both open source and commercial projects.},

	abstract = {This research examines the potential for new Health Level 7 (HL7) standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR, pronounced “fire”) standard to help achieve healthcare systems interoperability. HL7 messaging standards are widely implemented by the healthcare industry and have been deployed internationally for decades. HL7 Version 2 (“v2”) health information exchange standards are a popular choice of local hospital communities for the exchange of healthcare information, including electronic medical record information. In development for 15 years, HL7 Version 3 (“v3”) was designed to be the successor to Version 2, addressing Version 2's shortcomings. HL7 v3 has been heavily criticized by the industry for being internally inconsistent even in it's own documentation, too complex and expensive to implement in real world systems and has been accused of contributing towards many failed and stalled systems implementations. HL7 is now experimenting with a new approach to the development of standards with FHIR. This research provides a chronicle of the evolution of the HL7 messaging standards, an introduction to HL7 FHIR and a comparative analysis between HL7 FHIR and previous HL7 messaging standards.},

	title = {Engineering {Privacy} by {Design}},
	url = {https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/publications/article-1542.pdf},
	abstract = {The design and implementation of privacy requirements in systems is a difficult problem and requires the translation of complex social, legal and ethical concerns into systems requirements. The concept of “privacy by design” has been proposed to serve as a guideline on how to address these concerns.
“Privacy by design” consists of a number of principles that can be applied from the onset of systems development to mitigate privacy concerns and achieve data protection compliance. However, these principles remain vague and leave many open questions about their application when en- gineering systems. In this paper we show how starting from data mini- mization is a necessary and foundational first step to engineer systems in line with the principles of privacy by design.
We first discuss what data minimization can mean from a security en- gineering perspective. We then present a summary of two case studies in which privacy is achieved by minimizing different types of data, ac- cording to the purpose of each application. First, we present a privacy- preserving ePetition system, in which user’s privacy is guaranteed by hiding their identity from the provider while revealing their votes. Sec- ondly, we study a road tolling system, in which users have to be identified for billing reasons and data minimization is applied to protect further sensitive information (in this case location information). The case studies make evident that the application of data minimization does not neces- sarily imply anonymity, but may also be achieved by means of concealing information related to identifiable individuals. In fact, different kinds of data minimization are possible, and each system requires careful crafting of data minimization best suited for its purpose.
Most importantly, the two case studies underline that the interpretation of privacy by design principles requires specific engineering expertise, contextual analysis, and a balancing of multilateral security and privacy interests. They show that privacy by design is a productive space in which there is no one way of solving the problems. Based on our analysis of the two case studies, we argue that engineering systems according to the privacy by design principles requires the development of generalizable methodologies that build upon the principle of data minimization. How- ever, the complexity of this engineering task demands caution against reducing such methodologies to “privacy by design check lists” that can easily be ticked away for compliance reasons while not mitigating some of the risks that privacy by design is meant to address.},
